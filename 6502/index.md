The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8-bit processor first released in 1975. Loads of famous computers from 70s and 80s, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the BBC Micro, had a 6502. I've been having some fun learning to write games for the NES in pure assembly and this page documents the learning process.
