# UK petition poller

A small library that polls a specified petition on the [UK Government and Parliment petition site](petition.parliament.uk) every 60 seconds. The polling interval is hard coded on purpose, I don't want to be responsible if someone sets it really low, but it's easy to fork and modify the code if you want to change it.
